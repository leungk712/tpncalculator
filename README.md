#Total Parenteral Nutrition Calculator!

As a Clinical Dietitian, I work with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on a consistent basis whether patients are in the
critical care unit or general surgery floor. Total Parenteral Nutrition is a way to deliver nutrients (carbohydrates, 
protein, fats, vitamins, minerals) through intravenous fluids to help meet their daily nutrient goals. These patients 
that require TPN can range anywhere from short bowel syndrome, chronic nausea and vomiting with inability to consume
enough calories orally, cancer patients, small bowel obstructions, etc. 

TPN requires the Dietitian to calculate adequate needs while taking into considerations their electrolytes on a daily 
basis. This calculator helps Clinical Dietitians to calculate a patient's macronutrients which as a result will provide
the total calories from the TPN, the amount of calories per kilogram body weight (insert weight in pounds), alongside
calculating the amount of protein per kilogram body weight, and the glucose infusion rate (GIR). 

This helps the Dietitians ensure that they meet the minimum amount of fluids needed for their TPN to "fit" to ensure
adequate delivery. The duration of when the TPN can run is dependent on the Dietitian or if a patient has been on it previously
(ex. some patients have their TPN running for 12 hours vs. 24 hours).

This is by far one of my favorite projects as it allowed me to really learn a lot about DOM manipiulation. This project provided 
a lot of challenges/frustrations in terms of receiving a lot of NaN errors, HTML not responding to the JavaScript. This project 
was a lot of trial and error until I was able to complete the basics. Over time, I included the weight section (pounds) allowing 
me to further breakdown macronutrients, etc. With the amount of time I dedicated to this project alongside the amount of different
versions I have gone through, this was such a rewarding project once it was completed. 

This calculator is beneficial and will assist Dietitians from all over with their basic total parenteral nutrition needs!
